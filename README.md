ARM7 LPC2138/LPC2148 LCD interfacing programs

1. Overview
LCD (16x2 or 20x4) is widely used in embedded systems for displaying text and numbers.
ARM7 microcontrollers like LPC2138 / LPC2148 can interface with LCD in 4-bit or 8-bit mode.

Common LCD pins:
RS → Register Select (Command/Data)
RW → Read/Write (usually grounded for write)
EN → Enable
D0–D7 → Data lines (D4–D7 for 4-bit mode)
